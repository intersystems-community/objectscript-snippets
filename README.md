## intersystems-objectscript-template
This is a template for InterSystems ObjectScript Github repository.
The template goes also with a few files which let you immedietly compile your ObjecScript files in InterSystems IRIS Community Edition in a docker container

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and [Docker desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed.

## Installation 

Clone/git pull the repo into any local directory

```
$ git clone https://github.com/intersystems-community/objectscript-docker-template.git
```

Open the terminal in this directory and run:

```
$ docker-compose build
```

3. Run the IRIS container with your project:

```
$ docker-compose up -d
```

## How to Test it

Open IRIS terminal:

```
$ docker-compose exec iris iris session iris
USER>zn "IRISAPP"
IRISAPP>write ##class(PackageSample.ObjectScript).Test()
```
## How to start coding
This repository is ready to code in VSCode with ObjectScript plugin.
Install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Docker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker) and [ObjectScript](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=daimor.vscode-objectscript) plugin and open the folder in VSCode.
Open /src/cls/PackageSample/ObjectScript.cls class and try to make changes - it will be compiled in running IRIS docker container.

Feel free to delete PackageSample folder and place your ObjectScript classes in a form
/src/Package/Classname.cls
[Read more about folder setup for InterSystems ObjectScript](https://community.intersystems.com/post/simplified-objectscript-source-folder-structure-package-manager)

The script in Installer.cls will import everything you place under /src into IRIS.


## What's inside the repository

### Dockerfile

The simplest dockerfile which starts IRIS and imports Installer.cls and then runs the Installer.setup method, which creates IRISAPP Namespace and imports ObjectScript code from /src folder into it.
Use the related docker-compose.yml to easily setup additional parametes like port number and where you map keys and host folders.
Use .env/ file to adjust the dockerfile being used in docker-compose.

### Dockerfile-zpm

Dockerfile-zpm builds for you a container which contains ZPM package manager client so you are able to install packages from ZPM in this container.
As an example of usage in installs webterminal

### Dockerfile-web

Dockerfile-web starts IRIS does the same what Dockerfile does and also sets up the web app programmatically


### .vscode/settings.json

Settings file to let you immedietly code in VSCode with [VSCode ObjectScript plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=daimor.vscode-objectscript))

### .vscode/launch.json
Config file if you want to debug with VSCode ObjectScript
